Each StoX project consists of a list of data tables holding e.g. biotic and acoustic data, filtered versions of the data, strata system, definitios of primary sampling units, accompanied by a list of specifications of the StoX processes comprising the StoX project. A StoX process is an R function taking as input the project name, the input data and parameters used by the function.
