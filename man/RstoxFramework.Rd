\title{The engine of StoX}
\description{
This package contains all functions and framwork for running a StoX project.
}
\details{
The RstoxFramework package is the engine of the stock assesment utility StoX, which is an open source application fo acoustic-trawl and swept-area survey estimation.

The package creates an evironment containing the StoX project(s) in separate environments. Each StoX project consists of a list of data tables holding e.g. biotic and acoustic data, filtered versions of the data, strata system, definitios of primary sampling units, accompanied by a list of specifications of the StoX processes comprising the StoX project. A StoX process is an R function taking as input the project name, the input data and parameters used by the function.

The package replaces the old Java library in StoX versions prior to StoX 4.0.
