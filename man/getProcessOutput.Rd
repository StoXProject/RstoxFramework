\usage{
getProcessOutput(
  projectPath,
  modelName,
  processID,
  tableName = NULL,
  subFolder = NULL,
  flatten = FALSE,
  pretty = FALSE,
  pageindex = integer(0),
  linesPerPage = 1000L,

}
\arguments{
\item{projectPath}{The path to the StoX project, i.e., the folder of the project with the sub folders "input", "output" and "process". Can possibly be the path to a file inside the project folder.}

\item{modelName}{The name of the model (one of "baseline", "analysis" and "report").}

\item{processID}{The ID of the process.}

\item{tableName}{The name of the table to extract from the process.}

\item{subFolder}{If the process returns subfolders (ReadBiotic and ReadAcoustic, where the subfolders represent files), specify the name of the folder with this parameter.}

\item{flatten}{Logical: Should the output tables that contain cells of length > 1 be expanded to that the other columns are repeated, resulting in a regular table.}

\item{pretty}{Logical: If TRUE pad with space in each cell to the maximum number of characters of the column including header.}

\item{pageindex}{A vector of the pages to return with \code{linesPerPage} number of lines (rows). Default is to not split into pages.}

\item{linesPerPage}{The number of lines per page if \code{pageindex} is given.}

\item{columnSeparator}{The string to separate columns by, defaulted to a single space.}

\item{lineSeparator}{The string to separate lines by, defaulted to a NULL, which keeps the output as a vector of strings.}

\item{na}{The string to replace NAs by, defaulted to "-".}

\item{enable.auto_unbox}{Logical: If TRUE wrap the output in a list if  \code{pretty} is TRUE and the output is of length 1. This keeps the array when converting to JSON also for length 1.}

\item{drop}{Logical: If TRUE drop the list if only one element.}

\item{drop.datatype}{Logical: If TRUE drop the top level of the output if in a list, which is the level named by the data type.}
